# Welcome to Flyapi

## Motivation

In general, the idea of this simple project is quite spontaneous and simple - to make interaction with REST API simple, clear and type-safe. ***And the most important thing is that Flyapi allows you not to write hundreds of lines of overhead***

> The library does not support automatic generation of types, but you can do it yourself, and then designate types in the library!

## Features

**Flyapi** is quite simple and not packed with thousands of useless functions, here are its basic features:

- ✅ Type inference from *manually provided* interfaces
- ✅ Proxying any calls to the API
- ✅ String transformation in proxied calls
- ✅ Under the hood, [ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch) is used with all of the following features
